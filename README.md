# NystromMethod_Python

Creating through python a method to solve integro-diferential equations

A) Constructing a method that, given the [a, b] interval, the second member f, the coefficients α, β, the kennel K(x, t) and the quadrature rule to use, returns the numerical solution of the problem

(B) Constructing a concrete example where it's possible to see the exact numerical solution of the integro-diferential equation and using it to test the converfency level of the method for difference choices of quadrature rule and finite differences scheme

(C) Constructing an example where it's possible to verify that the convergency level of the method is affected once the kennel K(x,y) isn't sufficiently regular. (we want to check the decrease on the convergency level)
